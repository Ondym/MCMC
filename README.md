# MCMC

Here are the files created during the TV@J within the MCMC miniproject. The results and the math behind the contents of this repository are [here](https://tydenvedy.fjfi.cvut.cz/fyztyd/fyztyd/uploadsb/files/montemarkov_xx_180624_2316.pdf).

## The idea behind the project

This project deals with the problem of sampling from a predetermined Boltzmann distribution (Ising model) and analyzing it to answer the given questions using Monte Carlo and Markov chains (MCMC for short). 

## The problems to solve



## The results

1. Plot the dependence of the average energy on temperature.
2. Let _C_ be the number of connected black regions. Plot the
dependence of the expected value of _C_ and the temperature.
3. Let _L_ be the probability of percolations (forming of clusters
and their subsequent possibility of forming a chain connecting
the top and bottom, see the image lower). Plot this value with respect
to temperature.
