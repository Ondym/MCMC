# MCMC

Here are the files created during the TV@J within the MCMC miniproject. The results and the math behind the contents of this repository are [here](https://tydenvedy.fjfi.cvut.cz/fyztyd/fyztyd/uploadsb/files/montemarkov_xx_180624_2316.pdf).

## The idea behind the project

This project deals with the problem of sampling from a predetermined Boltzmann distribution (Ising model) and analyzing it to answer the given questions using Monte Carlo and Markov chains (MCMC for short). 

## The problems to solve



## The results

1. Plot the dependence of the average energy on temperature.
2. Let be the number of connected black regions. Plot the
dependence of the expected value of and the temperature.
3) Let be the probability of percolations (forming of clusters
and their subsequent possibility of forming a chain connecting
the top and bottom see Figure 4). We plot this value with respect
to temperature.
