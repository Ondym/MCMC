## The chaos game explorer

This programs is here, so you don't have to go through the Chaos game generated files. It displays one of the images from each subfolder. When a subfolder is selected, on the right will be showed the _params.md_, where are the parameters of generation and the images generated.

__For easier programming, there has to be a file selected in the designated folder, this is what the _temp-file_ is for.__
